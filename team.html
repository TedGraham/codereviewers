<td  width="525" valign="top">Our code reviewers tend to be more experienced than the average developer; most have at least ten years experience and have seen multiple architectural approaches.  Our staff have taught classes, published articles, contributed to well known products and founded companies.  </p>

<p>The last ten years have seen a major shift in how software is developed.  Instead of stand-alone projects, software continues to become more interconnected.  This complexity challenges architects and developers.  At the same time, software environments and frameworks now provide unprecedented functionality, allowing projects that leverage that functionality to deliver amazing software quickly.  </p>
